# FlowChart
The app was created to use with landscape mode on mobile devices. Tested in chrome mobile view, and on my Windows Phone.
The chart recieves its data from a mock service, which is randomly generating it. A user can filter, and zoom the chart data,

## Usage 
Upon loading the data is generated for the chart. Additional information is available if the user hovers on the chart line.
In desktop view te chart is zoomable with the selection of a data range, on mobile use pinch gestures.
All of the data lines is toggleable, by clicking or tapping on it. 
In the upper left corner there is two buttons, the leftmost gives you a pop up model where you can enter date values
to filter by it, the rightmost button will reload the chart data, and resets the filter too.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
